# Vision_Tracking

Problem Statement:
Our project focuses on leveraging Python's OpenCV library to develop an advanced vision system that enables a robot to detect and center itself on various game implements, such as disks and balls, within a gaming environment. The primary objectives include not only detecting the presence of these objects but also extracting valuable information regarding their shape, distance from the robot, and color. This technology aims to enhance the robot's capabilities for precise object manipulation and navigation in gaming scenarios.

Approach:
Our project's approach encompasses the following key components:

Object Detection: Utilizing OpenCV's computer vision capabilities, we will implement robust object detection algorithms to identify game implements within the robot's field of view. This detection will involve recognizing the distinct shapes and colors associated with these objects.

Object Localization: Once an object is detected, our system will determine its precise location within the robot's frame of reference. This will involve calculating the object's centroid and estimating its distance from the robot's current position.

Shape Recognition: Our system will be trained to recognize and classify the shapes of the detected objects, allowing the robot to distinguish between disks, balls, and potentially other game implements. This information is vital for making informed decisions during gameplay.

Distance Estimation: Using image processing techniques, we will calculate the approximate distance between the robot and the detected object. This information will be crucial for the robot's navigation and interaction with the objects.

Color Identification: The system will be capable of identifying the colors of the detected objects, further enhancing the robot's ability to interact with and respond to the gaming environment.

Overall, our project aims to create a comprehensive vision system that not only detects game implements but also provides detailed information about their shape, distance, and color. This system will empower the robot to autonomously navigate and interact with the gaming environment, making it suitable for a wide range of gaming applications and scenarios, from table games to robotic competitions.
